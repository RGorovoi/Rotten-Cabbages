This is an in-progress movie recommendation system built on public datasets and various filters for the **Fall 2025 NYU Tandon Data Science Bootcamp**. We aim to provide personalized and dynamic movie discovery.

**Datasets used:**
- TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata]
- MovieLens Dataset [https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/]

**Reccommendation models used:**
- Demographic filtering
- Collaborative filtering
- Content-based filtering

Our goal is to finalize the content-based filter and create a functional web application to implement these reccomendation models.
